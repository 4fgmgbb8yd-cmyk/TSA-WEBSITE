    <div class="timeline-detail-text">
      <p>Settlers began to arrive in the Winter Garden area in the 1950's. They were attracted by the fertile muck lands surrounding Lake Apopka. These muck lands provided much of the agricultural need for the settlers which quickly became a staple for the city. The settlers specialized in citus fruit and vegetable growth.</p>
      <p>Early settlers established small communities consisting of fellow farmers. These communities were located among the southern shore of Lake Apopka. Life was centered on living on both land and water. Lake Apopka served as the settler's lifeline it provided irrigation, transportation, and food.</p>
      <p>These early settlements while modest, had a tight community where everyone looked out for eachother. This can still be seen today in the now bustling city of Winter Garden.</p>
